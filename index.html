        <h3>Make America code?</h3>
        <h5>We are experienceing a worldwide industrial revolution because of the increasing relevance of technology. The demand for Digital skills in the worksgforce is FAR ahead of the supply.</h5>  <h5>Yet, we still have people without jobs. There is a divide in this country between tech-haves and tech-have-nots which stands in the way of technology is penetrating every area of industry and there simply is NOT enough talent to keep up with the demand. The techhnology companies at the top of the pile must help America learn how to code. Not only code but learn how to use digital tools in industry. Public education is in a state of disrepair. The responsibility falls on other citizens, especially the ones at the top to help the rest of the country catch up. We need computers. We need code camps. We need digital marketing intensives. We need social media marketing night classes. The issue of outsourced labor in the tech industry is significant. Americans who pay taxes are not reaping the benefits of the emergine new ecomny and THEY NEED YOUR HELP, SILICON VALLEY Silicon Beach, New York tech. THe time is now. Privateley sponsored hacakthons and a consistent stream of private donations geared at providing every child in the United stateds with a laptop and access to an internet connection.</h5>
